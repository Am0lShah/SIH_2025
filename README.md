📌 Project Overview

Millions of rural households in India still face frequent power shortages and blackouts due to poor monitoring and lack of predictive systems. Traditional power grids are expensive and ineffective in such areas.

Our proposed Renewable Energy Monitoring System integrates low-cost IoT sensors with a Raspberry Pi hub and uses cloud + AI/ML for predictive demand forecasting. The system empowers communities to monitor, predict, and manage their microgrids efficiently with minimal technical knowledge.

🎯 Objectives

Provide reliable electricity access in rural and semi-urban regions.

Enable transparent and real-time monitoring of renewable energy sources.

Predict future load demand to prevent outages and optimize energy usage.

Promote sustainability and reduce dependency on diesel generators.

Design an affordable, scalable, and community-friendly solution.

💡 Proposed Solution

Low-cost sensors measure voltage, current, power, battery SOC, solar/wind generation, and load.

Raspberry Pi serves as the central hub for edge data processing.

Data is transmitted via MQTT to the cloud.

Mobile & Web Dashboards visualize real-time performance.

AI/ML models predict energy demand and provide actionable insights.

Predictive maintenance alerts notify users about issues like battery health or turbine wear.

⚙️ Technical Approach

Languages & Frameworks

Python (data processing, backend)

Node.js + Express.js (server)

React Native (mobile app)

JavaScript (web frontend)

Hardware

Raspberry Pi (central hub)

Sensors: INA219, ACS712, PZEM-004T, Battery SOC meter, Wind RPM sensor

Arduino for auxiliary sensor control

Cloud & Analytics
